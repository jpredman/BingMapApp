BingMapApp
==========

First web map application using Bing Map API for Applications class
==========

This was a project created in my GIS Application Development class in the Masters of Professional Studies (M.P.S) in GIS program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. It was created using Eclipse IDE and Bing Maps AJAX controls. 

The application is a map of the Washington, D.C. area and all of the Smithsonian Museums in the district. It includes a list of the museums with a link to their respective pages. Info boxes pop up when you mouse over the lists or custom icons and disappear on mouse out. The lists and the picture in the info box link to the museum webpage.  

Also included is a "Get Directions" button that routes out the directions to three different museums.

==========
This was my first application created using JavaScript. While the application looks a little anachronistic, it was fun building an application that incorporates maps and learning how tinker with Bing Maps API and JavaScript in general.
